                <p>
                    We've all attended training of one kind or another;<br>
                    from the traditional institutions like schools and universities to workplace training or online
                    courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To record our achievements in those studies, we are issued a certificate or testament.
                    This could be a piece of official looking paper with a fancy bit of wax seal
                    or a simple email with a PDF attached.
                </p>
                <b>Well done!</b>

                <p>
                    Now we apply for a job and we send of our CV stuffed with these bits of paper.<br>
                </p>
                <b>Paper that is very difficult to verify for the recruiter.</b>
                <p>
                    It could be that school you attended burn't down;<br>
                    The online course website was shut down.<br>
                    You got your training in another country that had a coup!
                </p>
                <p><b>But you could also be dishonest and faked that certificate from a school that never existed!</b></p>
