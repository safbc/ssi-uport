                    We've all attended training of one kind or another;<br>
                    from the traditional institutions like schools and universities to workplace training or online
                    courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To record our achievements in those studies, we are issued a certificate or testament.
                    This could be a piece of official looking paper with a fancy bit of wax seal
                    or a simple email with a PDF attached.
