                    <p>The South African Financial Blockchain Consortium (SAFBC) aims to demonstrate the transformative
                        potential of blockchain technology for the South African financial industry. <br>Our Membership
                        is comprised of banks, financial markets infrastructure players and regulators as well as other
                        institutions involved in the financial services industry.</p>

                    <p>The SAFBC is proud to be driving the awareness and adoption of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) in
                        South Africa. </p>

                        <p>
                            Self-Sovereign Identity is the principle where all identity data about a user (called
                            <b>attestations</b> or <b>credentials</b>) is under their own control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SSI compliant Wallets, then enable the secure sharing of all or just part of that data
                            (called <b>Selective Disclosure</b>) with any requesting party.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To demonstrate this in practice we at the SAFBC have built a little game that will
                            guide to through a few of the many possible interactions to which digital identity will
                            have a profound impact in our lives in years to come.
