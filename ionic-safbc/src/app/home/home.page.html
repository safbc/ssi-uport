                    <p>The South African Financial Blockchain Consortium (SAFBC) aims to demonstrate the transformative
                        potential of blockchain technology for the South African financial industry. <br>Our Membership
                        is comprised of banks, financial markets infrastructure players and regulators as well as other

                        <h1>THE GREAT SSI QUEST</h1>
                        <p>Self-Sovereign Identity is the principle where all identity data about a user (called
                            attestations) is under their own control.</p>
                        <p>SSI compliant Wallets, then enable the secure sharing of all or just part of that data
                            (called Selective Disclosure)
                            with any requesting party.</p>

                        <p>
                            To demonstrate this in practice we at the SAFBC have built a little game that will
                            guide to through a few of the many possible interactions to which digital identity will
                            have a
                            profound impact in our lives in years to come.

                                    <p>This 'Identity' credential can be thought of as a digital version of your
